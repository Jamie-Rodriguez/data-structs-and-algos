# Data Structures & Algorithms 

This repo contains my own implementations of data structures and algorithms for reference in other projects and learning.

I mostly use JavaScript in this repo as I find it's the most easily adaptable to other languages and I also find the syntax more concise; so that I can focus on the algorithm, rather than the noise generated by typing systems.

Feel free to reuse, suggestions welcome.
